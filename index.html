    Hopefully you landed here on purpose. Just in case you haven't,
    don't worry its not that bad of a place around here. We are a group of friends who
    wanted a way to share content among ourselves for our own bemusement. To dive on in
    head over to our project page.

  <p class="w3-large">
    We are currently focusing our efforts on the following projects:
    <ul class="w3-ul w3-large w3-hoverable" style="margin-left:75px; list-style-type:square;">
      <li><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="{{ "/Projects/DrawingChallenge.html" | prepend: site.github.url }}">Drawing Program</a></li>
