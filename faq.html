  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Who Are You?</h1>
  <p>Two beings who felt this necessary.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What Is This?</h1>
  <p>Well you see this is cleary one of those internet things that keep popping up everywhere. This one is very clearly capable of anything and yet choses to do relatively nothing. Perhaps eventually we will figure out what we're doing, but its not the focus of this thing your currently viewing through your very poor eyes. Hopefully you've figured out by now that we answered your question by completely avoiding it. But then again you might be just as incompetent as we are.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What Is {{site.shortened_title}}?</h1>
  <p>Clearly a very bad attempt at shortening the title.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What Is With The Sites Name?</h1>
  <p>See above 'What Is This' for detailed confusion.</p>
  <p>In reality it was just a temporary thing that we were to lazy to change. It also very accurately details what we are doing: Absolutely Nothing.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What If I Still Have Questions?</h1>
  <p>Good Luck With That.</p>
